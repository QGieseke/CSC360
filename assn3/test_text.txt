There are multiple lines
Four score and seven years ago
Our fathers brought upon us a new
nation, one wrought in liberty and justice for all
Yadda yadda yadda
There are many things to write about here,
But I need to make sure that it is more than one block in size
I was in the forrest hoping to see the trees but none were there
I found a girl
she found the earlking
dancing in the light
leaves broke above
then fell below
I was in the white wood 
gamboling out to picknic 
light above
and fell below
I was in the middle groung
hoping to find the fountain
of infinite mirror
trees falling no one would hear
shadow of nobody there
murders of murderers 
living in fear of it.
